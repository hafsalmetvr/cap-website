		<p>Scales primarily in the ones and twos ('occasionally' and 'almost never') are likely mean that this individual may has a more 'transactional' communication style, in which a discussion or conversation is only a functional exchange of words, without it needing to take account of any circumstantial context or feelings. They may also push their own agenda or communication priorities strongly at the expense of the other party.</p>
		<p>A low score person will usually keep their communications very direct and put personal outcomes or needs very much at the forefront. They may interrupt frequently and guess what the other person is going to say. This means that they may often miss important parts of the overall message, or create the impression that they have only a limited attention span for deeper or more complex issues.</p>

		<p>Scales primarily in the fours and fives ('almost always' and 'very frequently') are likely to mean that this individual naturally generates a sense of warmth towards people, and offers lots of help and support in facilitating an easy flow of conversation (in both directions). They will therefore usually listen attentively and adapt or adjust their personal style to suit the situation as much as necessary to create the best possible climate.</p>
		<p>A high score person will be likely to spend as much a time as necessary in engaging in 'small talk' or 'discovery led' conversation, in order to read the full needs of the other party and to offer supportive and insightful comments that can help to open up the discussion. This means that they will seek to establish the most appropriate communication climate for the circumstances, and offer an open ear to listen empathetically.</p>
