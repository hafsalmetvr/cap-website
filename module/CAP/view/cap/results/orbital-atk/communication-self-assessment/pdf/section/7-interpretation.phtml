		<p>Scales primarily in the ones and twos ('occasionally' and 'almost never') are likely mean that this individual may be often lost in longer or more complex conversations, and fails to spot the more subtle or underlying messages that are communicated. They may also infrequently take the opportunity to reduce or eliminate their confusion by asking questions, paraphrasing or summarizing where necessary in the conversation.</p>
		<p>A low score person will be likely to find that they do not always follow another person's line of discussion or argument or not find it easy to predict where the conversation may be going next.  As a result, they may not participate as actively in
		a conversation as they might or offer responses that are as helpful and intelligent as they could be.</p>

		<p>Scales primarily in the fours and fives ('almost always' and 'very frequently') are likely to mean that this individual carefully sifts and sorts what they see and hear when individuals are talking and work hard to both appreciate the entire message and to respond in a way that amply demonstrates their understanding.</p>
		<p>A high score person will be likely to use empathetic listening techniques in their communications and recognize that how other people think or send their messages should not be judged from merely their own personal perspective.  They will therefore progressively assemble data communicated and look beyond the words to feelings, emotions and other contextual factors as well.</p>
