		<p>Scales primarily in the ones and twos ('occasionally' and 'almost never') are likely mean that this individual generally misses non-verbal clues given by others or misinterprets them through a lack of appreciation about what they mean.  This means that they are not likely to be good at reading other people, sensing communication atmospheres or spotting general discrepancies between verbal and non-verbal messages.</p>
		<p>A low score person will be likely to find themselves to be almost wholly reliant on the words that people use in communication (often only 10% of the entire meaning being transmitted) and oblivious to signals from facial expressions, movements of the
		hands or feet, changes in inflection and tone and other clues that help to gain a full picture about what people are saying and feeling.</p>

		<p>Scales primarily in the fours and fives ('almost always' and 'very frequently') are likely to mean that this individual is well tuned into the non-verbal clues or signals that are deliberately or accidentally offered by other people in different kinds of communication. This means that they will typically be not only alert to the signals but will also be able to interpret them successfully.</p>
		<p>A high score person will be likely to focus as much on non-verbal communications as they do on the words being spoken, and constantly look for reinforcement of underlying feelings or inconsistency when it arises.  They will therefore, almost intuitively be able to read people and situations, even where words are few and even non-existent at times.</p>
