		<p>Scales primarily in the ones and twos ('occasionally' and 'almost never') are likely mean that this individual may not always fully appreciate what people communicate or may miss important components of the overall message.  They are also prone to being easily distracted and to jump into conversations before the sender has finished speaking.</p>
		<p>A low score person will be likely to find that communications can be frustrating or even confusing. Although blame may often be attributed to the sender, this is more likely to arise as a result of poor listening, given insufficient time and focus to hearing the full message and letting the mind wander to other things (or supposedly greater priorities and tasks).</p>

		<p>Scales primarily in the fours and fives ('almost always' and 'very frequently') are likely to mean that this individual is an attentive listener and effective at appreciating the tone of most communications in whatever form they may take.  They will therefore concentrate genuinely and focus well on what people say to them and maintain a calm and patient demeanor to let people get their message across without interruption.</p>
		<p>A high score person will be likely to be seen as a highly appreciative and attentive listener and one that freely gives of their time and energy to ensure that they have done as much as possible to hear and appreciate the sender's full message.  High scorers will therefore tend to be much more valued when an individual is looking to communicate important or complex information to someone, and gain their insight or comment.</p>
