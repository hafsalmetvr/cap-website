		<p>Scales primarily in the ones and twos ('occasionally' and 'almost never') are likely mean that this individual  is not an infrequent giver and receiver of feedback of any sort, and may even go out of their way to avoid making constructive comments to others or letting them offer comment (positive or negative) to them.  They may therefore, adopt a silent approach or become evasive when asked to offer or take feedback.</p>
		<p>A low score person will be likely to adopt a 'closed' communication style in which they offer little or no constructive feedback to others and in turn, do not expect others to offer feedback to them.  Conversations may therefore be somewhat 'mechanical' and exchange orientated with neither party gaining the benefit of useful guiding or coaching communication.</p>

		<p>Scales primarily in the fours and fives ('almost always' and 'very frequently')
		are likely to mean that this individual is a frequent giver and receiver of feedback and sees it as a positive way to improve communication and knowledge for themselves and others. They will therefore, be adept at giving feedback to others and in inviting others to give feedback to them (and acting on the valuable advice they receive).</p>
		<p>A high score person will be likely to quickly establish as much conversational rapport as possible with the other communication party. This is usually done by suggesting their openness to receiving and giving constructive feedback to each other as a means to building strong relationships, and by having deeper or more genuinely worthwhile discussions with people.</p>
