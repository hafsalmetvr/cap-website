		<p>Scales primarily in the ones and twos ('occasionally' and 'almost never') are likely mean that this individual is prone to forget the needs of different audiences to which they communicate. They also do not necessarily select the most appropriate communication channels on all occasions (and use mainly one single communication or delivery style regardless of the situation).</p>
		<p>A low score person will be likely to find communication to be a challenge and perhaps something to 'get over and done with' as quickly as possible.  Transmitting their message may well be regarded as a 'chore', which often yields mixed results in terms of people's capacity to be seen to be able to listen or understand properly and act appropriately on what they have heard.</p>

		<p>Scales primarily in the fours and fives ('almost always' and 'very frequently') are likely to mean that this individual thinks carefully about the channels through which they transmit their message and the communication style that they adopt in order to be successful. To do this, they try hard to always be clear, concise and consistent in what they say and do.</p>
		<p>A high score person will be likely to be acutely aware of the power to communicate and influence people successfully through good preparation, audience needs analysis and a versatility of transmission methods designed to ensure that every individual is given the best opportunity to appreciate the message.</p>
