		<p>Scales primarily in the ones and twos ('occasionally' and 'almost never') are likely mean that this individual rarely uses questions to increase their understanding in their communications. Their questions may also lack incisiveness (or possibly make the other person feel that they have not been listening or are not interested in all of what they have got to say).</p>

		<p>A low score person will be likely to generally engage in highly 'transactional' discussions and conversations in which questions of clarification are asked only exceptionally. Because they are also unlikely to summarize or paraphrase the sender's message frequently, they are likely to create the impression that their mind is elsewhere some of the time or that they will only ask questions when they want more information on subjects that are of interest to them.</p>

		<p>Scales primarily in the fours and fives ('almost always' and 'very frequently') are likely to mean that this individual is skilled at using a variety of conversational techniques to check information without making the other party uncomfortable, or feel interrogated. They generally therefore, adopt a calm and careful questioning approach whenever they feel unsure and are not clear about the message being transmitted.</p>
		<p>A high score person will be likely to create a climate in which the information sender is given frequent indications that the receiver is concentrating and looking to fully understand the communication.  This is achieved by using questions to demonstrate openness and a genuine desire to understand, rather than to demonstrate superior knowledge or to ask a question for the sake of saying something rather than nothing.</p>
