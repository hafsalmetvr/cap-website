				<p>Your results indicate that you use very few, if any strategies to help you set and achieve your goals - or if you do, they are not being explored to their full potential. If success and accomplishment are really important to you, you need to start developing a realistic and solid plan to get there. Some effective goal-setting techniques that many people use include writing a detailed list of their goals and deadlines to achieve them, rewarding themselves after accomplishing a specific step or objective, stating their goals in positive terms, and segmenting larger goals into smaller steps. It's not only essential to have a detailed plan of action, but you must also be willing to make adjustments along the way, as certain developments may require that you adjust the timeline, or the goal itself. Remember that you need more than a will to accomplish your goals - you also need a way!</p>
