				<p>Motivation is the energy that drives you to accomplish goals, and it’s necessary for all types of success. While it’s easy to embark on the pursuit of a worthwhile goal, the ability to maintain the momentum to ensure its accomplishment is another issue altogether. When your motivation is low, your commitment, determination and passion are tested. You become aware that your worthwhile goal will remain just that, unless you get motivated and stay motivated to achieve it.</p>

Having no goals at all will almost certainly cause low motivation, but badly-planned goals, or those that are too vague or aren’t in line with the company's direction, can have the same effect. Goals that are well-defined, within the grasp of reality and adhere to the company's primary objectives, mission and scope of work, will almost always result in positive motivation.</p>
